# Experimenting with an Instapaper-like Progressive Web App

This is a project to play with [Progressive Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps?hl=en#getstarted) technologies. I'm using [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/) as basis for it's behaviour, but not planning to implement a real client.

The basic feature set will be:

- View a list of saved articles (default)
- View an individual saved article

## Roadmap

- App structure
- Fixture article data
- Server-only article list and view
- Basic web-app style UI
- Progressively enhance navigation/fetching of content
- Service-worker registration
- App shell caching
- Content caching
- App manifest

## Other things to play with

- Use SCSS, with a [BEM](https://en.bem.info/) approach
- [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features)
- Adding linting with [`.eslintrc`](http://eslint.org/) and SCSS Lint
- Try [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) / [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)
